Fosscord is a free open source selfhostable chat, voice and video discord-compatible platform Why the name Fosscord? Fosscord is a combination of the abbreviation FOSS ( F ree O pen S ource S oftware) and the name Dis cord . Philosophy Fosscord aims to be a full one-on-one clone of Discord, adding more features that can be used as a replacement for the official client and still connect to discord.com and host private Fosscord server instances. Fosscord aims to give the best possible user experience, while being backwards compatible to Discord's features and adding new ones/improving old ones while maintaining the user privacy with end-to-end encryption support. The client can connect to multiple server instances without the need to open it multiple times. The client should be extensible through a secure Plugin and Theme System with own store. The server should be extensible through bots, just like discord without the need to change anything except the api endpoint. The project is open source so everyone can have a look what's going on under the hood and can be maintained and expanded by the community. Everything is configurable in the server config and everyone can add their own features, so that it is not opinionated. Concept Why backwards compatible to Discord? Benefit from the large user base of discord -> make a better client No disadvantage for the users who use fosscord, so that they can still communicate with all friends who use discord Discord has already built a great and stable protocol (don't reinvent the wheel) (We can still add additional features) Support Discord server If we are finished, we'll host our own support server.","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#what-is-fosscord","text":"Fosscord is a free open source selfhostable chat, voice and video discord-compatible platform","title":"What is Fosscord?"},{"location":"index.html#why-the-name-fosscord","text":"Fosscord is a combination of the abbreviation FOSS ( F ree O pen S ource S oftware) and the name Dis cord .","title":"Why the name Fosscord?"},{"location":"index.html#philosophy","text":"Fosscord aims to be a full one-on-one clone of Discord, adding more features that can be used as a replacement for the official client and still connect to discord.com and host private Fosscord server instances.
