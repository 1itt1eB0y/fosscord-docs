# Themes

## Philosophy

-   Themes should look all the same on all platforms
-   Themes should be made with an visual theme editor to easily create and edit your own themes
-   Themes should be combinable to use multiple themes at once
-   Themes should be installable and submit to a Store with voting options
-   Guilds should be able to specify their own themes
